"""
    Diagram{T1, T2} <: AbstractVector{Tuple{T1, T2}}
A struct representing a diagram, also takes care of the edge mode.

Arguments:
    - bubbles: A vector of bubbles.
    - freqs: A vector of tuples of BVectors. The first element of the tuple is the up-bubble, the second is the down-bubble.
    - shape: A vector of tuples representing the shape of the bubbles.
    - up_poles: A vector of vectors representing the up-poles of the bubbles.
    - down_poles: A vector of vectors representing the down-poles of the bubbles.
    - num_poles: An integer representing the number of poles in the diagram.

        Diagram(freqs::Vector{Tuple{BVector{T1}, BVector{T2}}}
    A Diagram constructor taking a vector of tuples of BVectors. Useful if you want to specifically define the special mode manually.

    Returns:
        - Diagram: A Diagram struct. Note that the first bubble must be denoted special for normal operation.
