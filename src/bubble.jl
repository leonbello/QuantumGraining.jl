"""
    Bubble{T1, T2} <: AbstractVector{Tuple{T1, T2}}    
A struct representing a bubble, also takes care of the edge case.

Arguments:
    - up: A BVector representing the up-bubble.
    - down: A BVector representing the down-bubble.
    - shape: A tuple representing the shape of the bubble.
    - special: A boolean representing whether the bubble is a special edge mode bubble.

        Bubble(freqs::Vector{T}, shape::Tuple{Int, Int}, special::Bool)
    A Bubble constructor taking a shape `(n, m)` and a vector of frequencies in the form [μ1, μ2, μn, ν1, ν2, νm]. 

    Arguments:
        - freqs: A vector of tuples of vectors. The first element of the tuple is the up-bubble, the second is the down-bubble.
